# Mytheresa-Clone
This is my first construct week project 
# mytheresa.com clone

Mytheresa is an online shopping destination for children, men and women's luxury clothing, bags, shoes, and accessories.

AS part of unit 2 construct week i cloned the frontend of Mytheresa to the best of my ability as individual in the span of 5 days.
